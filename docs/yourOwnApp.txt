Snowdrop OS - Writing your own app
by Sebastian Mihai, http://sebastianmihai.com


Writing your own app targeting Snowdrop OS is very similar to writing a COM program in DOS. The main exception is that you cannot rely on int 21h, which is DOS-specific. 

Take a look at the source code of the "hello" app in src\apps\hello.asm. It is the most bare-bones program which fully respects the Snowdrop OS app contract.

Then take a look at build\assemble.bat to see how to assemble your program using Nasm. The binary has to have a .APP extension in order to be recognized as an app.

You can also decide to have your app run automatically upon booting by specifying its name in the SNOWDROP.CFG kernel configuration file.

If you choose to extend the Snowdrop OS kernel, read extending.txt.
