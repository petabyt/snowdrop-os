Snowdrop OS was born of my childhood curiosity around what happens when a PC is turned on, the mysteries of bootable disks, and the hidden aspects of operating systems. It is a 16-bit real mode operating system for the IBM PC architecture. I developed this homebrew OS from scratch, using only x86 assembly language. I also wrote a few, very small apps, as well as ported one of my games to it. After all, what kind of an operating system doesn't have games?

The Snowdrop OS and the apps are distributed as both a floppy disk (1.44Mb) image, as well as a CD-ROM image. The images contain the following, all programmed from scratch:

- a boot loader which loads the kernel into memory
- a kernel which sets up interrupt vectors to be used by user apps, and then loads the startup app
- user apps, including a console (command line interface), a few simple test apps, and aSMtris, my Tetris clone
